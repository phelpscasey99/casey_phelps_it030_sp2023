		<div> I made this website about my favorite animated shows: Avatar the Last Airbender and The Owl House. Each show has its own page, which you can find on the navigation bar above. </div>

		<div>I started watching <em>Avatar the Last Airbender</em> when I was a little kid, and I started watching <em>The Owl House</em> when over this past summer and it quickly became one of my favorites.</div>

			I used <a href="fandom.com">Fandom</a> to find most of the pictures used. Fandom is a platform that is like a fan-run Wikipedia for video games, movies, and tv shows; and it allows fans to connect and share information. I've found it really helpful when playing games that have a lot of details that may not be noticable right off the bat, or when I get really into a show and want to learn more about characters.

		<div>
			I also tried to be creative with the colors in CSS to see what I could come up with. This home page was harder to try to color because it did not have a theme like the pages for the shows.
